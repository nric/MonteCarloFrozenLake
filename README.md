# MonteCarloFrozenLake
This is a monte carlo controll on policy first visit solution (ordinary importance sampling) to the discrete toy text open ai gym enviroment FrozenLake-v0. 
Theoretically, it should be able to solve all toy text gym enviroments but here it is tested for Frozen Lake.
It is written using visual studio code with Jupyter Kernel connection (Python interactive). 
Just run the cell. If you want to run using python interpreter directly, replace def main(): to if name == 'main': and remove the last line (call of main()).
